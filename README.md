# YADWS - Yet Another Dynamic WordPress Slider

Such a clumsy name has been chosen on purpose. There are currently over 700 slider plugins in WordPress repository. YADWS is going to be just one of them.  Despite the great variety, neither of the available plugins provides one specific requirement that the authors had on one of their recent projects. We had to build a custom plugin that allowed adding several images on one slide. At the end of the project it grew into an independent product that we are proud to present.  

### v0.5 Alpha Release
The first release fulfills the main requirement - allows putting an arbitrary amount of images on an unlimited amount of slides. It is intended for developers first of all. Think about it as a framework that provides basic JavaScript carousel functionality, hence flexibility. Here is the list of features YADWS provides:

 - Flexible administration that allows adding of multiple images on an unlimited amount of slides. Choosing the images aspect ratio is administrator's responsibility. The plugin doesn't cut the images, it only resizes them. 
 - Integration with Media Library - it is possible to choose existing images from the library.
 - Simple reorganization of the images and slides.
 - Support of an unlimited amount of sliders on a page.
 - Two types of navigation: bullets and arrows.
 - Basic theme, convenient for customization.
